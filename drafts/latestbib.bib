	the problem of recognizing frequent episodes in such sequences of

	within time intervals of a given size in a given partial order. Once
	such episodes are known, one can produce rules for describing or
	predicting the behavior of the sequence. We describe an efficient
	algorithm for the discovery of all frequent episodes from a given
	class of episodes, and present experimental results.},

  abstract = { Obtaining training data for land cover classification using remotely
	sensed data is time consuming and expensive especially for relatively
	inaccessible locations. Therefore, designing classifiers that use
	as few labeled data points as possible is highly desirable. Existing
	approaches typically make use of small-sample techniques and semisupervision
	to deal with the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we propose
	an active learning technique that efficiently updates existing classifiers
	by using fewer labeled data points than semisupervised methods. Further,
	unlike semisupervised methods, our proposed technique is well suited
	for learning or adapting classifiers when there is substantial change
	in the spectral signatures between labeled and unlabeled data. Thus,
	our active learning approach is also useful for classifying a series
	of spatially/temporally related images, wherein the spectral signatures
	vary across the images. Our interleaved semisupervised active learning
	method was tested on both single and spatially/temporally related
	hyperspectral data sets. We present empirical results that establish
	the superior performance of our proposed approach versus other active
	learning and semisupervised methods. },

	of digital music. We formulate the hashing and retrieval problems
	analogously to that of text retrieval and leverage established results
	for this unique application. Accordingly, songs are represented as
	a ''Bagof- Audio-Words'' and similarity calculations follow directly
	from the well-known Vector Space model [12]. We evaluate our system
	on a 4000 song data set to demonstrate its practical applicability,
	and evaluation shows our technique to be robust to a variety of signal
	distortions. Most interestingly, the system is capable of matching
	studio recordings to live recordings of the same song with high accuracy.},

	a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables.
	The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered
	disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective
	of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily
	interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended
	to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function
	values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that
	the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning
	and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression

	Bayes, and CART. These top 10 algorithms are among the most influential
	data mining algorithms in the research community. With each algorithm,
	we provide a description of the algorithm, discuss the impact of
	the algorithm, and review current and further research on the algorithm.
	These 10 algorithms cover classification, clustering, statistical
	learning, association analysis, and link mining, which are all among
	the most important topics in data mining research and development.

In virtually all of the work on learning these networks, the assumption is that we are presented with a data set consisting of randomly generated instances from the underlying distribution. In many situations, however, we also have the option of active learning, where we have the possibility of guiding the sampling process by querying for certain types of samples. This paper addresses the problem of estimating...",

    abstract = {{A resampling scheme for clustering with similarity to bootstrap aggregation (bagging) is presented. Bagging is used to improve the quality of path-based clustering, a data clustering method that can extract elongated structures from data in a noise robust way. The results of an agglomerative optimization method are influenced by small fluctuations of the input data. To increase the reliability of clustering solutions, a stochastic resampling method is developed to infer consensus clusters. A related reliability measure allows us to estimate the number of clusters, based on the stability of an optimized cluster solution under resampling. The quality of path-based clustering with resampling is evaluated on a large image data set of human segmentations.}},
